# drawing_days

Extension project of https://github.com/KalindiFonda/daydrawing, where a string, rappresents the light and darkness of a location on a certain date.

In this project I want to reach the following:
- get the page "online"
- allow the user to input
	- date
	- location
- show it with colors on the page.

Future maybe:
	more dates - more locations,
	twiglight accurate,
	daylight savings fix,
	put it actually online


##### Running google app engine
- go into the google app engine folder
- run: python dev_appserver.py /project/folder/path
