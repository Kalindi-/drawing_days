# Daydrawing
The main idea behind daydrawing is to take in a date and location and return a string reppresenting the light and night on such date in such a location.


#### Why?

I wanted to work on something for a bit, so this was it.




#### How?

Run it either with the `daydrawing.py` and the `play_here()` command.

Or by creating a `DayImageOnDate(location_string:cityname, date_string:YYYY-MM-DD)` object and calling its `make_drawing()` method.

---

More fun: make comparison between cities or dates.

Take a list of locations, and call `print compare_locations(locations_list, "YYYY-MM-DD")`
Take a list of dates, and call `print compare_dates(location, date_list)`
